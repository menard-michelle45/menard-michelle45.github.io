Welcome to Nichijou!! Nichijou (日常 Nichijō, lit. Everyday), also known as My Ordinary Life in North America, is a Japanese comedy manga series written and illustrated by Keiichi Arawi (ja). The manga began serialization in the December 2006 issue of Kadokawa Shoten's manga magazine Shōnen Ace, and was also serialized in Comptiq between the March 2007 and July 2008 issues. Kadokawa Shoten later published all chapters of the series in ten tankōbon volumes from July 2007 to December 2015. Set in a suburban Japanese town, Nichijou is populated by an ensemble set of characters, featuring moments from their everyday lives which alternate between the mundane and the strange, without much focus on a narrative.
